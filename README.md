*About the program*

This entire program was created with java's vector graphics ability and various mathematical algorithms.
 Being nearly entirely dynamically generated (other than the menus), this was my first project on dynamic generation algorithms.

There is a shop that allows you to upgrade specific abilities (including special abilities).
The abilities (such as bullet spread) are mathematically calculated to produce the desired effect.

As levels progress, more asteroids get added for extra difficulty, and the speed of said asteroids increase.</br>
 For fairness, the generation of asteroids is restricted such that both their initial path and their position would not immediately destroy the players ship.

Each asteroid breaks apart into two separate and smaller asteroids (that are dynamically designed and created).
At the same time, they occasionally drop a varying green square that gives money.
