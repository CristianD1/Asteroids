<h3><div style="text-align:center">About the program</div></h3>

			</br>

			<p>This entire program was created with java's vector graphics ability and various mathematical algorithms.</br>

				 Being nearly entirely dynamically generated (other than the menus), this was my first project on dynamic generation algorithms.</br></p>

![Alt text](/screens/Main.jpg "Title")

			</br>

			<p>There is a shop that allows you to upgrade specific abilities (including special abilities).</br>

				 The abilities (such as bullet spread) are mathematically calculated to produce the desired effect.</p>

			<p>As levels progress, more asteroids get added for extra difficulty, and the speed of said asteroids increase.</br>

			   For fairness, the generation of asteroids is restricted such that both their initial path and their position would not immediately destroy the players ship.</p>

			<p>Each asteroid breaks apart into two separate and smaller asteroids (that are dynamically designed and created).</br>

			   At the same time, they occasionally drop a varying green square that gives money.</br>
